== Electron

A portfolio engine for awesome software developers. It slices, dices, and makes an amazing martini.

It uses Rails 3, MongoDB, and Blueprint.css for great justice!

The relevant files for MongoDB are:

* config/application.rb
* Gemfile
* config/initializers/mongo.rb
* app/models/user.rb (as an example)

To start the server:
rails server

To start the console and play with the user model:
rails console

All of this assumes that you've installed Rails 3 and have a mongod process running.
