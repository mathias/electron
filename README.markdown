As of August 3, 2013, this project has been unmaintained for a long time. I do not recommend using it for anything other than a reference. It also represents some really old coding on my part, so don't read into it too much.

A portfolio engine for awesome software developers.

Runs on the [Monk.rb skeleton](http://monkrb.com) and Redis. It slices, dices, and makes an amazing martini.

To use, first configure your Redis settings in config/redis then:

    monk redis start
    ruby init.rb
